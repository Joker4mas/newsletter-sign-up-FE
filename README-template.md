## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Flex box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript] - Functionality
- [Tailwindcss]- For styles and Responsive view ports


### What I learned

In the course of this task i learned how to create
functions and functions calls. I learned how to create toggle buttons, addEvent handlers to buttons, and also create a RegExp to match data input.
Giving me a different perspective about what a real form functionality should be like.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I have to keeping on improving on my Javascript learning path, i have to take on more of such task to reinform the my learning.


### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation] - This helped to validate email. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
